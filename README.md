I have developed an app using the MVVM architecture. To handle API calls, I used a background service. Since IntentService is no longer supported from Android 11 onwards, I implemented both background and foreground services. The service uses Retrofit to fetch data from three APIs: photo, album, and user, all executed within coroutines for better performance.Once the API responses are received, the data is stored in a Room database. I used StateFlow to gather reactive data from the Room database inside the ViewModel. After retrieving all the responses from the Room database, I mapped the data according to our requirements into a new data model. This new data model is then displayed in a RecyclerView within the HomeFragment.
